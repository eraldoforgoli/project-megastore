# project-megastore
Megastore Manager
My first web application with the main use to manage the basic functionalities of a megastore.    
Admin and Cashier functionalities included. Backend build using: Java. Database: MySql.  
Frontend build using : Vue.js , JavaScript, HTML/CSS , Bootstrap. Web Services: REST API.  

## Note
Frontend is build using Vue.js by importing it as script and not by using npm (CLI) because i was in the process of learning Vue.js 
and didn't consider the scalability of the application.
